# Parralax-Website
Hello Github community!  Continuing with my 10-day journey of creating and sharing HTML/CSS responsive projects for students and beginners, here is Day 3!

# About Parallax Scrolling Website

## Overview
The Parallax Scrolling Website is a visually stunning and engaging web page that demonstrates the parallax scrolling effect using HTML and CSS. This project features multiple sections with background images that move at different speeds, creating a dynamic and immersive experience for users. The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless viewing experience across various devices.

## Key Features
Parallax Scrolling Effect: Background images move at different speeds to create a depth effect as the user scrolls.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a great user experience.
Fixed Backgrounds: Background images remain fixed while the content scrolls over them.
Elegant Typography: Utilizes custom fonts and styles for headings and paragraphs to enhance readability and aesthetic appeal.

## Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure and content of the web pages.
CSS3: Styling and layout, including the parallax effect and responsive design techniques.

## How It Works
Parallax Effect:
The parallax effect is achieved using CSS properties such as background-attachment: fixed, background-size: cover, and background-position: center.
Responsive Design:
Media queries are used to adjust styles for different screen sizes, ensuring the website looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Future Enhancements
Interactive Elements: Add interactive elements like buttons and links to enhance user engagement.
Smooth Scrolling: Implement smooth scrolling for a better user experience.
Additional Sections: Include more sections with different parallax effects to showcase versatility.
